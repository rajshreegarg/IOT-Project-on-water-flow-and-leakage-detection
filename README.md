# IOT-Project-on-water-flow-and-leakage-detection
This project comprises of two parts. One is to detect the water  flow and the other is to analyze the water quality. To detect the water flow we are using an IOT setup which basically comprises of Arduino board, water flow sensors, LCD, and Wi-Fi module. To analyze water quality, we would be implementing K-means clustering algorithm on certain values such as pH etc.
